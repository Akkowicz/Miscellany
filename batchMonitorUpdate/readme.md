Batch Monitor Update

This script is for batch updating monitors over a single account.

Provide both your API key and your APP key.

It gathers a list of all monitors definitions which are stored as dictionaries.

You can then get the key of whatever attribute you are interested in and make any changes necessary.

The example code is used for changing an email address that is contained in the message attribute.
